# Download Files with Directory Structure Script

This repository contains a Bash script that automates downloading files from a list of URLs while preserving the local directory structure based on the URLâ€™s path (starting after the domain). The script also skips files that already exist locally. It offers multiple options for providing the URLs, making it easy to add more files.

## Features

- **Multiple Input Options:**
  - **Command-Line Arguments:** Supply one or more URLs directly when running the script.
  - **URL List File:** If no URLs are provided as arguments, the script reads from a file named `urls.txt` (one URL per line).

- **Automatic Directory Creation:**  
  The script creates directories based on the URL path after the domain. For example, the URL  
  `https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.min.css`  
  creates a local directory `swiper/` and saves the file as `swiper-bundle.min.css`.

- **Skip Existing Files:**  
  If a file already exists locally, the script skips downloading it.

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing:**
   - **Command-Line Arguments:**  
     If URLs are provided when invoking the script, those URLs are processed.
   - **URL List File:**  
     If no arguments are provided, the script checks for a file named `urls.txt` and reads URLs from it.

2. **Removing the Protocol and Extracting the Path:**
   - The script removes `http://` or `https://` from each URL.
   - It then extracts the file path after the domain. For example:
     - `https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.min.css` becomes `swiper/swiper-bundle.min.css`.
     - `https://cdn.userway.org/widget.js` becomes `widget.js` (saved directly in the current directory).

3. **Directory Creation:**
   - If the extracted path contains directories, the script creates them using `mkdir -p`.

4. **Downloading Files:**
   - The script uses `curl` with the `-L` flag to download each file.
   - If the file already exists locally, it is skipped.
